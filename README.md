      I have created a folder structure to make the project organized, added a header that should always be visible, and implemented an IconButton style designed for system vectors. I aim to represent as many elements as unique icons, such as the 'gear' for settings.

    I have incorporated a file explorer that recognizes Swift, JSON, PNG, and JPEG files and highlights them accordingly. Here comes the first feature: you can drag and drop multiple projects into the file explorer. This allows you to orient yourself with other projects and compare code sections without having to switch windows. I have also started implementing a Settings Area and filled it with placeholders

      Now it starts to work like it should and colorizes the code.

    To get this working I had added some extensions to Color and NSColor and did it another way than I had on mind before.
    </p>
    Now it recognizes some cases more and highlights them. I will improve the logic so I can get some more cases of Code type
